You are tasked with creating a responsive grid layout for a portfolio website. Implement a grid layout using CSS Grid that satisfies the following requirements:

Grid Container:

Use CSS Grid to create a layout with 3 columns and 2 rows.
The columns should take up equal space (1fr) and the rows should adjust based on content (auto).
Grid Items:

Create six grid items (div elements) inside the grid container.
Each grid item should have a distinct background color, different from its neighboring items.
Grid Areas:

Define specific areas within the grid using grid-template-areas to create a structured layout.
Include areas for a header, sidebar, main content, and footer.
Alignment:

Center the grid container horizontally on the page.
Align the items within their respective areas using grid-area.
Responsive Design:

Implement a media query that changes the grid layout to a single column on screens narrower than 768px.
Ensure that each item stacks vertically in the new layout.
Instructions:

Use appropriate CSS properties (display, grid-template-columns, grid-template-rows, grid-template-areas, justify-items, align-items, etc.) to achieve the layout.
