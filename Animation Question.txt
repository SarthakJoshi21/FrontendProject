You need to design a dynamic content card for a website that includes the following animations and interactions:

Fade-In and Slide-Up on Page Load:

The content card should smoothly fade in and slide up from the bottom of the viewport when the page loads.
The fade-in and slide-up effect should last 1.5 seconds and use an ease-in-out timing function.
The card should remain in its final position and opacity after the animation ends.
Pulsing Effect on Hover:

When a user hovers over the content card, it should pulse to draw attention.
The pulsing effect should last 1 second per cycle, start immediately upon hover, and repeat indefinitely while hovering.
The pulse should scale the card from its original size to 1.05 times its size and then return to the original size.
Content Toggle on Button Click:

Inside the content card, there is a button that toggles the visibility of additional content (e.g., a description or details section).
When the button is clicked, the additional content should smoothly fade in or out.
The fade effect should last 0.5 seconds and use an ease-in timing function.
The additional content should be hidden by default and only visible when toggled.
To achieve these requirements:

Define the necessary @keyframes rules for fading in, sliding up, pulsing, and fading in/out.
Write the CSS rules to apply these animations based on the described scenarios (page load, hover, and button click).
Structure the HTML and CSS to ensure that the content card, pulsing effect, and content toggle function as specified.
Provide the complete HTML and CSS code to achieve this functionality.

Expected Solution Overview:
HTML Structure:

A container for the content card.
An additional content section inside the card.
A button to toggle the visibility of the additional content.
CSS Code:

Use @keyframes to define the animations for fade-in, slide-up, pulsing, and fading in/out.
Apply animations using CSS properties such as animation, transition, transform, and opacity.
Utilize CSS pseudo-classes and selectors to manage hover states and content toggling.
